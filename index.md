Hi, I'm Karl, a PhD in Physical Chemistry with emphasis in Colloidal Chemistry.
I finished my PhD in 2019 and am currently working as a research chemist at
LABORE, a group dedicated to studying oil reservoirs, since June/2019.

## Current work and interests

My current role is main researcher in a project where I am developing solutions
to combat lost circulation, financed by PETROBRAS. My tasks are varied, from
literature review, planning and performing experiments, mentoring students, and
also more administrative tasks, such as procuring reagents and equipment.

I am also collaborating on a project focused on using biopolymers, financed by
Shell. My main responsibility is consulting on the chemical aspects of the
system, and implementing NMR relaxometry to study wettability.

I am interested in using my knowledge in colloidal chemistry to solve
real-world problems and create useful applications.

## Professional achievements

I have always been interested in working in the industry. My approach was to
become an expert in my field, and alongside my expertise I would bring ancillary
knowledge in other fields.

So far, I have worked indirectly for two companies, Shell and Petrobras, as a
researcher (CLT). My approach was very successful, as I have become very
versatile in the group. For example, with my data analysis and general
programming skills, I have automated several data acquisition and analysis steps
of the NMR, allowing us to perform previously impossible tests. This, allied
with my chemical knowledge, made it possible to gain additional insights into
our problems.

In the future, I wish to continue being a learner and also become a
teacher/mentor to others, share my knowledge, and build new, interesting, and
useful things.

## Education

I got my bachelor in Chemistry at Unicamp in 2012. Then, I joined Edvaldo
Sabadini's research group, where I did my Master's and my PhD. In both instances
I studied wormlike micelles. More details of my education can be found
[here](education.html)

## Other interests and projects

I have a few concurrent interests, many of which are offline. I have several
coding projects of varying levels of completion, which are available on [my
GitHug page](github.com/KarlClinckspoor). For an overview of my projects, check
