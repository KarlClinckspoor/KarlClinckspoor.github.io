Hi, I'm Karl, a PhD in Physical Chemistry with emphasis in Colloidal Chemistry, surfactants, polymers
and interfaces. I finished my PhD in 2019 and am currently working as a researcher at
LABORE, a group dedicated to studying oil reservoirs, since June/2019.

## Current work and interests

My current role is main researcher for a project financed by Shell, about the use of biopolymers
for enhanced oil recovery. My attributions are many and varied, but I can focus on:

* Consultancy about any chemical matters
* Data collection, data analysis, and automation.
  * I am currently working on two relatively large Python packages to streamline the data analysis
    of all types of experiments performed in the lab (Core-flooding, Tomography, Rheology and more).
    The larger package has several thousand lines of code and hundreds of unit tests.
  * I have written a variety of small scripts to automate the execution of certain repetitive tasks.
    This increased productivity of a certain analysis from 2 days for 1 dataset to 10 datasets per
    day at least.
* Literature review
* Paper writing, reviewing
* Grant writing, reviewing
* Presentations
* Internal knowledge consolidation, writing and updating internal tutorials and best-practices guides
* Experimental techniques I am currently using frequently
  * Rheology
    * Fluid viscosity and viscoelastic behavior
  * Low-field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
    * Porous structures pore size distributions 
    * Average, viscosity determination 
    * Rock sample wettability alterations
  * Medical Tomography
    * Density, effective atomic number and porosity images, profiles and averages
    * Pore property distributions (volume, area, diameter and shape)
  * Two-phase core flooding
    * Efficacy determination of a certain enhanced oil recovery method, e.g. polymer flooding, 
      compared to water flooding.
  * Densimetry
    * Fluid density 
* Training and mentoring

Previously, I worked on a research project financed by Petrobras, in the same research group, where
we proposed two fluids for lost circulation remediation, that were activated by an external or internal trigger.
