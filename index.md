Hi, I'm Karl, a PhD in Physical Chemistry with emphasis in Colloidal Chemistry.
I finished my PhD in 2019 and am currently working as a research chemist at
LABORE, a group dedicated to studying oil reservoirs.

My current role is project lead, where I am developing solutions without solids
to combat lost circulation in fractured oil reservoirs, financed by PETROBRAS.
My main tasks are varied, from literature review, planning and performing
experiments, mentoring students, and also 

I am also
collaborating with a project focused on using biopolymers for enhanced oil
recovery.
