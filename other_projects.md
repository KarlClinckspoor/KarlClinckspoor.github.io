# Other projects

## Security

There's this implementation of the "haveibeenpwned.com" API. You supply it with
a password you use, and it returns, safely, if your password has been
compromised previously.

## History

I also decided to transform reddit's Askhistorians best questions and answers
into a book. I stopped after they said they didn't have any interest in it. It's
very crude and primitive, but I might pick it up at some later date.

## Data analysis

I also used my own Android phone's accumulated location data and some Python
tools to visualize my daily commute and trips in recent years.

I did some crude Data analysis on the chemical industries from 2012 to 2014, in
Brazil. Unfortunately, I couldn't get any more detailed data, so the project
died early. [Link](https://github.com/KarlClinckspoor/IndustriaQuimica)
## Programming in general

There's this C# Project that aims to recreate Ultima Underworld 1 and 2 in
Unity. It's way above my head, but one of the tools they developed is an
extractor. The executable itself is now available at the [main
repo](https://github.com/hankmorgan/UnderworldExporter), but that wasn't the
case before. I spent some time figuring out how to build it, and had to actually
change some stuff in the C++ code. I am actually a bit proud of this, since I
consider C++ to be one of the hardest languages to deal with. The link to the
extractor is

## Secrets

In addition, I'm developing some other repos, privately. When they are ready,
I'll list them here.
