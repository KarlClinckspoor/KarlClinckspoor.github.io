# Other projects

## Evolution of a Thesis Film

This has its own page. [Evolution of a Thesis Film](evol_thesis.html)

## Security

There's this implementation of the "haveibeenpwned.com" API. You supply it with
a password you use, and it returns, safely, if your password has been
compromised previously.

## Cheat on wordle and termooo

I created a small portable script in Python to suggest words given the hints provided by the 
attempts made. Silly but fun. [Link](https://github.com/KarlClinckspoor/wordle_helper)

## Recipe book

I've been working on modernizing my recipes, with a language-agnostic way of writing them,
and I plan eventually to create a website that serves these recipes, based on filters (ingredients,
tags). [Link](https://github.com/KarlClinckspoor/LivroDeReceitas)

## Randomizer

I'm working on learning C# and decided to implement a randomizer for the 1992 DOS game Ultima
Underworld, one of my all-time favorites. Still in development. [Link](https://github.com/KarlClinckspoor/UnderworldRandomizer)

## How my phone tracked my commute and international trips

I also used my own Android phone's accumulated location data and some Python
tools to visualize my daily commute and trips in recent years.

## Reddit scraping and reformatting:

I also decided to transform reddit's Askhistorians best questions and answers
into a book. I stopped after they said they didn't have any interest in it. It's
very crude and primitive, but I might pick it up at some later date.
