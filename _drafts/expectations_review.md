Having spent some time in academia, I've received many reviews on my papers. I'm going to write 
out what I would like to tell my reviewers but cannot, really.

### Please be helpful

Your purpose is to increase the quality of the paper, not demolish the author! Read the paper 
with an open mind and, consider your own biases, and provide suggestions with improvements. 
Inquire rather than accuse. Be specific, but not too specific. For example, saying "The 
literature review could be improved", "the language could be improved" is nigh useless. What I'm 
probably going to do is to just revisit some previous searches, add a few new references, 
correct a few passages and tell you "thanks". 

### Save your energy

If you're reading a paper, start by addressing the big picture stuff, then go down to 
section-level criticisms, and only if you have time and energy left, go after citation errors, 
commas, etc.

If you notice a passage is, in your opinion, wrong or misleading, 

A review is not the process in which all the faults are pointed out, especially if it's mundane 
things like punctuation or citation style. Save your strength, reviewer! Actively work on 
noticing what is wrong *and what could be better*. If you just see a passage and write "this is 
wrong" is not helpful (unless, of course, it's something blatant, but that's not often the case).
You should say something like "This passage goes against the prevailing view in the literature. 
X is supposed to be Y (ref1, ref2). Why did you say this?"

### Be varied
