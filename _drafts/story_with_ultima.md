In this post, I'm sharing my personal story with the Ultima series. This seems like a weird 
theme for a post, especially on a "CV"-type blog, but whatever, I wanted to share something. 
Maybe it's nostalgia speaking.

Growing up in the early 90s, I had limited access to computers. Not only were they expensive, but I
had absolutely no idea how to use DOS, configure memory, and couldn't read English very well. This
limited my capacity to play games on the computer, so I played mostly on my SNES and N64. My father
bought a collection CD, maybe around 95-96, with a ton of
really good games (perhaps a type of EA classics?). In it, there were 3 ultima games, Ultima
Underworld, Ultima VII and Worlds of Ultima: Savage Empire. Other notable examples are Chuck
Yeager's Air Combat, Shadowcaster, Populous and Space Hulk. We had some other games before, most 
on floppies, but this CD was an absolute gold mine.

My father knew English the most in our home, so he could read the manuals and install stuff. 
These were DOS games, so you had to quit out of Windows and restart in DOS mode. There, you had 
to type the commands to install and run the games. After installing, he would leave handwritten 
notes on the margins with what commands you had to type to run the games.

Still, the complexity of these games was too much for kid me. I think the only one I could play 
was Air Combat, because we had a joystick, and the interface was relatively easy. Since many 
missions started and ended while airborne, no difficult takeoffs or landings were necessary. And 
there were cheats for infinite ammo and no damage. The other games I just watched my father play.

I have very little memory of this. The only game I remember him playing was Ultima Underworld. 
Specifically, I remember the creepy skull that appeared when you died, and the creepy blue face 
of Garamon during the intro. He never got very far, at most level 3 I think (from a talk a few 
years later).

These were good times, and I was innocent, and very very bad at videogames. Morton's castle (nr 2)
in Super Mario World was too tough for me. Zelda Ocarina of Time was a matter of exhaustive trial
and error (couldn't read) and playground rumors. Sometimes, someone's cousin or uncle would get past
an obstacle and then pass the knowledge to the younger generation. I remember studying and
theorycrafting about a ton of aspects of these games. I think that in Zelda, there's some passage a
Kokiri kid says that suggests a curse befalls the forest when a Kokiri leaves, or something to that
effect. This got distorted by the game of telephone of the playground, and a kid was 100% sure that,
when you leave the forest as a kid, after beating the Great Deku Tree, you doomed the forest.
Actually what happened was that the day-night cycle advanced in Hyrule Field, and the creepy
Stalkids appeared at night. We were deathly afraid of these skeletons, so we couldn't leave the
forest anymore. To top it off, it was dark, because it was nighttime, so it looked cursed. We were
convinced we had doomed the land. I remember one day just braving the skeletons and running past
them. I even visited this friend of mine and showed him how to get out. He almost took the
controller out of my hands because of how frightened he was. 

You can notice these stories are mostly about console games. My overall story playing PC Games, 
especially Ultima, is mostly a lonely one. I never really got into multiplayer games all that 
much. And I'm the only person I know that knows of Ultima, so I don't really have people to talk 
about that.

Anyway, going forward a few years, after 2000. We had moved and upgraded our PC. The internet 
was starting to catch up.
