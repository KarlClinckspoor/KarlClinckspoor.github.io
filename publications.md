### (2021) Urea induces (unexpected) formation of lamellar gel-phase in low concentration of cationic surfactants

[Link](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.09.018)

I received news of this one and the next article literally 1 week apart! Academia is truly an 
unexpected place. Anyway, on to the story of this one.

This is the last remaining part of the work I conducted during my PhD. I was certain I didn't 
have enough data, or enough answers, to warrant publication as a full article. Some suggested I 
publish this as a letter to a journal. Letters are typically very short, only include the most 
relevant information. So that's what we did.

First, we tried with ACS Omega, in the format of a letter. It fell on the lap of some dude called
who has beef with my advisor. He was part of a friend's thesis committee and snubbed my supervisor,
in front of everyone. My supervisor was, and is, a very fine and controlled person, but he looked
definitely down after that. Since then, I've had this guy in my personal "black book" of names, a
position reserved for very few. Why do so many academics *need* to be so distasteful?

When we got the answers to our paper, I could feel this dude was happy at our failure, despite 
not having any evidence of the fact. Reviewer 1 made good observations, but his comments were 
focused as if we were trying to basically create a phase diagram of this system, which was *not* 
the case. We were simply showing that the formation of this lamellar gel-phase is unusual, and 
we reported it. And he said the packing parameter is useful in water only, which is false. I had 
to remove some data and text from the original draft because otherwise it wouldn't fit in the 
letter format, which is much more limited than a normal paper, so his additional information 
would probably not even fit in the format. 

Reviewer 2 receives the medal, though. Here's how their review starts:

    These kind of papers are annoying for both the reviewer(s) and the editor. The submitted
    manuscript is a lab report rather than a decent scientific paper and certainly deserves not
    publishing. Although it should not be my task to read and comment these kind of
    contributions I will briefly outline my main points of criticism:

And they go on to state that the results are obvious - which the last reviewers noted *wasn't*
the case. If it was obvious, why is it so hard to find anything on the subject in the literature?
Then, they give a long list of papers we should have cited - the majority of which are, being
generous, tangentially related to the subject, and not helpful to the case the paper was trying to
make, at all. For example, *none* of them mentioned urea, which was the main point we were trying to
make! The cherry on top was that the *first* paper they ask us to cite has as corresponding author
one of the reviewers I recommended, and this name repeated itself twice more in the reference list.
Now, there's no proof that this isn't a coincidence, but if it isn't, that really unprofessional of
you, C. S.

Then, we tried in this new journal called "Experimental Results". The whole stick of this 
journal is that they are focused on publishing results, not necessarily answers. They advertised 
the paper focusing on this aspect. I thought this was a fine opportunity, so we submitted to 
this journal. Man, I got one of the *worst* reviews I ever had the displeasure of reading. Here 
it is, in **full**:

    Conductivity could be monitored during the transitions to check for urea degradation!.

That's it. Nothing else. The worst part is that the suggestion is basically *nonsense*. The other 
reviewer was better, asked for some adjustments here and there, the normal stuff. I was quite 
furious with something so unprofessional, so I contacted our liaison with the journal, Dr. A. B. 
I expressed my disgust (not the words I used) with the review I got, and told them I understood 
if they kept their decision, but I wanted another reviewer to judge my paper. Literally 1 month
later, to the day, I got an answer, saying they understand my disappointment but there was nothing
they could do, and that I should take the reviewers comments into consideration and resubmit it. And
you know what? I didn't. I will never try publishing in this journal, and will speak ill of it 
to everyone I meet - not that this will affect them in any way, it's for the *principle*.

A long time passes, but my supervisor hasn't given up on this paper yet. He enlists the help of 
a new master's student, the second author of the paper, Fernando Okasaki. He was once a student 
of mine during experimental physical-chemistry lab - I just hope I wasn't an ass with him or 
anyone else in general (I overthink my social interactions sometimes). He made some additional 
measurements and found a few good references to the paper and, together with my supervisor, they 
shape the paper up to something much more presentable. We submit to a journal, much better than 
the two previous ones, and we get some very good reviewer comments, and finally get it accepted. 
Hooray! What a journey. I can't thank him enough for his part in helping this paper get 
published, and also I can't thank my supervisor enough for not giving up on me.

### (2021) Bulk rheology characterization of biopolymer solutions and discussions of their potential for enhanced oil recovery applications

[Link](https://doi.org/10.29047/01225383.367)

This is my first journal article published while working in LABORE. This one was a doozy. It was 
started by my predecessor, was revised several times, then overhauled to include more data, then 
politics dictated some of this data had to be removed, and then this was reviewed several mores 
times, rejected at least twice before we decided to submit to CT&F, a journal of the Colombian 
firm Ecopetrol. The review process was unusual - we submitted a docx document and received 4 
docx documents, each with comments. Funnily, some were not anonymized. In any case, the article 
turned out very satisfactory, and the aesthetics of this journal made it look even better.

### (2020) Safety, Tolerability and Effects of Sodium Bicarbonate Inhalation in Cystic Fibrosis

[Link](https://doi.org/10.1007/s40261-019-00861-x)

This was an interesting article. I was contacted by one of the coauthors, Prof.
Pessine, to do some rheological analyses of mucus. A bit grossed out, I
accepted. After a ton of work and more than 500 experiments (each with 3
separate data sets), we finished a *part* of the work necessary. And it's funny
how sometimes stuff just aligns. Had I not decided to learn Python a few months
prior, I would not have been able to analyze the absolutely huge amounts of data
in any reasonable time. [I made some time ago a short demo video of one of the
scripts I developed at work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_MGW1XuRM). Dr. Carla, the leader, conducted the rest of the
enormous work necessary, and contacted a statistician to provide the rest of the
calculations necessary. 
 
I was very satisfied with the work, a very noble endeavor. In short, we noticed
that inhaling sodium bicarbonate led to patients with the genetic disease
*cystic fibrosis* experienced an improvement in their quality of life. A far cry
from my more fundamental studies so far, and very inspiring.

### (2019) A new interpretation of the mechanism of wormlike micelle formation involving a cationic surfactant and salicylate

[Link](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2019.05.025)

I had minimal contributions to this work itself. My main contribution was
obtaining the initial data and performing preliminary experiments. As I was
focused on something else, my group colleagues noticed how interesting some of
the results I had were and developed this work.

This article is very niche, basically deals with something only our group
studied at that time, which is the formation of wormlike micelles based on
isothermal titration calorimetry. We had a previous interpretation ([here](#the-thermal-signature-of-wormlike-micelles)) of the
results after much thinking, and this article updates that interpretation using
some additional spectroscopic techniques.

### (2018) Rheological and calorimetric study of alkyltrimethylammonium bromide-sodium salicylate wormlike micelles in aqueous binary systems

[Link](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2018.01.024)

This article explains the core part of my thesis. Normally, studies focus on the
effects a small amount of additives that place themselves on the micellar
palisade and change their properties, e. g., sodium salicylate (NaSal) leads to
growth of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Few studies consider what the
solvent is doing. In this work, I kept the wormlike micelle system (CTAB+NaSal)
and changed the solvent by adding relatively large amounts of water-soluble
compounds.

The inspiration came from the work of Prof. Hoffmann, who we befriended in a
congress in Cyprus in 2014. He explained how adding glycerol led to a change in
the properties due to changes in the attractive forces between the micelles,
which can be indirectly viewed by the diffractive index difference between
solvent and micelle. We tested this hypothesis and added more parameters that
would explain our results, such as the Gordon parameter.

Of all the additives, two were most surprising. First, sucrose had almost no
effect on the system, despite it having several similar properties to Glycerol.
The other aspect is that urea led to crystallization at higher concentrations
(>35%). We still don't fully understand this fact and have tried to publish our
findings, but so far our work wasn't accepted anywhere.

The idea of the camel and dromedary was mine and I'm still proud of it. I think
having light-hearted parts to science is very beneficial.

### (2016) The thermal signature of wormlike micelles

[Link](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jct.2015.10.021)

This article came after several students of my supervisor used isothermal
titration calorimetry to study wormlike micelles, and we had sufficient data to
propose some better hypotheses to what was happening.


### (2015) A Rehage-Hoffmann rheological approach to worm-like micelles of C16TAB and ortho-hydroxycinnamate

[Link](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00396-015-3672-y)

This is the main article of my master's dissertation. I studied this weird
additive, ortho-hydroxycinnamate, and how pH affected the properties of the
micelles. The most pleasant part was working with the additive, since it smelled
good. Adjusting the pH still gives me nightmares. Don't trust any person
reporting pH measurements to within 0.01 (or even 0.1) of any complex system,
especially one that has a cationic surfactant.

### (2012) Triboelectricity: Macroscopic Charge Patterns Formed by Self-Arraying Ions on Polymer Surfaces

[Link](https://doi.org/10.1021/la301228j)

This article came out when I was still an undergrad. I did a lot of the work and
plots contained in it, but the interpretation and writing was left to the other
people. I'm still a bit upset that another student that helped me a lot wasn't
added to the author list because, in the words of my supervisor, "she didn't
truly understand what was happening because she's an engineer". 

## Book chapters

### New Insights into the Formation of Wormlike Micelles: Kinetics and Thermodynamics

My advisor wrote most of the writing, I was tasked with literature review, text
revision, making the figures prettier and formatting stuff. It was a great honor
to participate in this, and I have Dr. Dreiss to thank for that. I hope I get to
meet her in the future, even though I'm not in the area anymore.
