## Articles in journals

### Safety, Tolerability and Effects of Sodium Bicarbonate Inhalation in Cystic Fibrosis

[Link](https://doi.org/10.1007/s40261-019-00861-x)

This was an interesting article. I was contacted by one of the coauthors, Prof.
Pessine, to do some rheological analyses of mucus. A bit grossed out, I
accepted. After a ton of work and more than 500 experiments (each with 3
separate data sets), we finished a *part* of the work necessary. And it's funny
how sometimes stuff just aligns. Had I not decided to learn Python a few months
prior, I would not have been able to analyze the absolutely huge amounts of data
in any reasonable time. [I made some time ago a short demo video of one of the
scripts I developed at work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_MGW1XuRM). Dr. Carla, the leader, conducted the rest of the
enormous work necessary, and contacted a statistician to provide the rest of the
calculations necessary. 
 
I was very satisfied with the work, a very noble endeavor. In short, we noticed
that inhaling sodium bicarbonate led to patients with the genetic disease
*cystic fibrosis* experienced an improvement in their quality of life. A far cry
from my more fundamental studies so far, and very inspiring.

### A new interpretation of the mechanism of wormlike micelle formation involving a cationic surfactant and salicylate

[Link](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2019.05.025)

I had minimal contributions to this work itself. My main contribution was
obtaining the initial data and performing preliminary experiments. As I was
focused on something else, my group colleagues noticed how interesting some of
the results I had were and developed this work.

This article is very niche, basically deals with something only our group
studied at that time, which is the formation of wormlike micelles based on
isothermal titration calorimetry. We had a previous interpretation ([here](#the-thermal-signature-of-wormlike-micelles)) of the
results after much thinking, and this article updates that interpretation using
some additional spectroscopic techniques.

### Rheological and calorimetric study of alkyltrimethylammonium bromide-sodium salicylate wormlike micelles in aqueous binary systems

[Link](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2018.01.024)

This article explains the core part of my thesis. Normally, studies focus on the
effects a small amount of additives that place themselves on the micellar
palisade and change their properties, e. g., sodium salicylate (NaSal) leads to
growth of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Few studies consider what the
solvent is doing. In this work, I kept the wormlike micelle system (CTAB+NaSal)
and changed the solvent by adding relatively large amounts of water-soluble
compounds.

The inspiration came from the work of Prof. Hoffmann, who we befriended in a
congress in Cyprus in 2014. He explained how adding glycerol led to a change in
the properties due to changes in the attractive forces between the micelles,
which can be indirectly viewed by the diffractive index difference between
solvent and micelle. We tested this hypothesis and added more parameters that
would explain our results, such as the Gordon parameter.

Of all the additives, two were most surprising. First, sucrose had almost no
effect on the system, despite it having several similar properties to Glycerol.
The other aspect is that urea led to crystallization at higher concentrations
(>35%). We still don't fully understand this fact and have tried to publish our
findings, but so far our work wasn't accepted anywhere.

The idea of the camel and dromedary was mine and I'm still proud of it. I think
having light-hearted parts to science is very beneficial.

### A Rehage-Hoffmann rheological approach to worm-like micelles of C16TAB and ortho-hydroxycinnamate

[Link](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00396-015-3672-y)

This is the main article of my master's dissertation. I studied this weird
additive, ortho-hydroxycinnamate, and how pH affected the properties of the
micelles. The most pleasant part was working with the additive, since it smelled
good. Adjusting the pH still gives me nightmares. Don't trust any person
reporting pH measurements to within 0.01 (or even 0.1) of any complex system,
especially one that has a cationic surfactant.

### The thermal signature of wormlike micelles

[Link](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jct.2015.10.021)

This article came after several students of my supervisor used isothermal
titration calorimetry to study wormlike micelles, and we had sufficient data to
propose some better hypotheses to what was happening.

### Triboelectricity: Macroscopic Charge Patterns Formed by Self-Arraying Ions on Polymer Surfaces

[Link](https://doi.org/10.1021/la301228j)

This article came out when I was still an undergrad. I did a lot of the work and
plots contained in it, but the interpretation and writing was left to the other
people. I'm still a bit upset that another student that helped me a lot wasn't
added to the author list because, in the words of my supervisor, "she didn't
truly understand what was happening because she's an engineer". 

## Book chapters

### New Insights into the Formation of Wormlike Micelles: Kinetics and Thermodynamics

My advisor wrote most of the writing, I was tasked with literature review, text
revision, making the figures prettier and formatting stuff. It was a great honor
to participate in this, and I have Dr. Dreiss to thank for that. I hope I get to
meet her in the future, even though I'm not in the area anymore.
